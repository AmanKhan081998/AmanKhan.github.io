        and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in Detective Comics
        #27 (May 1939). Originally named the "Bat-Man", the character is also

    </p>
    <p>  Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire, 
        playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises. After 
        witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne as a
        child, he swore revenge on criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of 
        justice. Wayne trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a
        bat-inspired persona to fight crime. Batman operates in the fictional
        Gotham City, with assistance from various supporting characters, 
        including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Gordon, and vigilante
        allies such as Robin. Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess
        any superpowers; rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical 
        prowess, martial arts abilities, detective skills, science and 
        technology, vast wealth, intimidation, and indomitable will. A large 
        assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his 
        archenemy, the Joker.</p>

                <img src="./img/wayne.png" alt="Bruce Wayne" id="image" />

                <p>Batman's secret identity is Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American
                    industrialist who resides just outside of Gotham City. As a
                    child, Bruce witnessed the murder of his parents, Thomas 
                    Wayne and Martha Wayne, which ultimately led him to craft
                    the Batman persona and seek vengeance against criminals. 
                    Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial 
                    playboy idly living off his family's fortune, which was 
                    amassed through investment in real estate before the city
                    became a bustling metropolis, and the profits of Wayne
                    Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate.Bruce Wayne resides 
                    just outside of Gotham City in Wayne Manor. He supports 
                    philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation,
                    but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite. 
                    Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, 
                    crime-fighting accounts for most of his time  </p>
